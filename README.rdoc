== SHARON CHOE DOT COM

This website is built with a Rails 4 backend (blogging, administration) using RESTful resources and an Angular.JS frontend.

My name is Sharon Choe.  I was in the healthcare industry for four years as a pharmacist and I felt un-fulfilled with the skillsets in that profession.  I wanted to do something more with my life.  What you see here is a fruition of about two months of work.  I started learning HTML/CSS, some JavaScript, and finally tried out Angular.  I am in love.  Angular makes everything so easy to build and deploy.  Please have a look around.

Feel free to contact me if you're looking for hire.  I'm in the market for my next gig.
